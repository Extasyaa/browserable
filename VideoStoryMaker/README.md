# VideoStoryMaker

## Requirements
- Xcode 15+
- macOS 13+

## Running
1. Open `VideoStoryMaker.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
2. Choose the `VideoStoryMaker` scheme and your Mac as the run destination.
3. Press **Run**.

If Xcode attempts to build a scheme named `Package` or shows errors referencing `PackageDescription`, make sure there is no stray `Package.swift` file and that the Xcode project is opened directly.

API keys for external services are optional. Without keys, the app uses stub services that return placeholder data.
