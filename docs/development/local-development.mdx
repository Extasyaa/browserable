## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (usually comes with Docker Desktop)

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the Browserable repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/browserable/browserable.git
cd browserable
```

### Start the Development Environment

The development environment is containerized using Docker Compose. To start all services:

```bash
docker compose -f deployment/docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

This will start all the required services including:

- UI Server (http://localhost:2001)
- Tasks Server (http://localhost:2003)
- MongoDB (port 27017)
- MongoDB Express UI (http://localhost:3300)
- Redis (port 6379)
- MinIO Object Storage:
  - API (http://localhost:9000)
  - Console (http://localhost:9001)
- Supabase Services:
  - Database (port 5432)
- Docs (http://localhost:2002)

### Available Interfaces

Once the development environment is up and running, you can access these interfaces:

1. **Main Application UI**
   - URL: http://localhost:2001
   - The main Browserable user interface

2. **Tasks Server**
   - URL: http://localhost:2003
   - Handles background tasks and browser automation

3. **MongoDB Express**
   - URL: http://localhost:3300
   - Username: admin
   - Password: pass
   - Web interface for managing MongoDB data

4. **MinIO Console**
   - URL: http://localhost:9001
   - Username: browserable-storage
   - Password: secret1234
   - Object storage management interface

## Development Workflow

The development environment is set up with hot-reloading enabled. Any changes you make to the source files will automatically trigger a rebuild of the affected components.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Ports Already in Use**
   - Make sure no other services are running on the required ports
   - You can modify the port mappings in `docker-compose.dev.yml` if needed

2. **Docker Services Not Starting**
   - Check Docker logs: `docker compose -f deployment/docker-compose.dev.yml logs`
   - Ensure Docker has enough resources allocated

3. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Verify that the database container is healthy: `docker ps`
   - Check the database logs: `docker compose -f deployment/docker-compose.dev.yml logs db`
