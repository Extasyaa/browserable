# Browserable API Reference

Welcome to the Browserable API documentation. Our API enables you to programmatically create and manage tasks, monitor their execution, and retrieve results.

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using an API key. You need to include your API key in the request headers:

```bash
'x-api-key': 'your_api_key'
```

If you don't include an API key or use an invalid one, you'll receive an error response.

Where to find the API Key?
- In local deployment, open ui -> API Keys (http://localhost:2001/dash/@admin/settings)
- In the cloud version, login to your dashboard (https://app.browserable.ai) -> Settings

## Response Format

All API responses follow a consistent format:

```json
{
  "success": boolean,
  "data": object | null,
  "error": string | null
}
```

- `success`: Indicates if the request was successful
- `data`: Contains the response data when the request is successful
- `error`: Contains error message when the request fails

## Base URL

- The base URL for local deployment, if you followed the default setup, would be `http://localhost:2003/api/v1`
- The base URL for cloud API is: `https://api.browserable.ai/api/v1`
- The base URL for self hosted version would be where your 'browserable-tasks' container is deployed

## Rate Limiting

Please contact support for information about rate limits for your specific plan.

## Error Codes

The API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of requests:

- `200`: Success
- `400`: Bad Request
- `401`: Unauthorized
- `403`: Forbidden
- `404`: Not Found
- `500`: Internal Server Error
