## Storage Configuration

Browserable uses MinIO for object storage by default, but can be configured to work with various storage solutions.

### Current Configuration

The default configuration includes:
- MinIO for object storage
- MongoDB for task data
- Redis for caching and queues

We are working on detailed documentation covering:
- Recommended storage configurations
- Performance optimization guidelines
- Backup and recovery strategies
- Alternative storage providers

### Coming Soon

Detailed guides for:
- Cloud storage integration (S3, GCS, Azure)
- Storage scaling strategies
- Data retention policies
- Backup automation
