# VideoStoryMaker

macOS SwiftUI application that automates creation of video stories using ChatGPT, Grok image API and YouTube upload.

## Features
- Generate story text from tone and prompt through ChatGPT API.
- Create scene images via Grok API.
- Assign time codes and synthesize narration using ChatGPT TTS (fallback to system TTS).
- Render final 1080p video with AVFoundation.
- Upload resulting video to YouTube.
- Logging to on-screen console and file.

## Configuration
Provide API keys via environment variables before launching:
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
export GROK_API_KEY="your-key"
export YOUTUBE_API_KEY="your-key"
```

## Building
The repository contains a Swift Package. Open `Package.swift` in Xcode 15+ and run the `VideoStoryMaker` scheme. All dependencies use Swift Package Manager.

The package includes an Xcode project automatically generated by Xcode when opening the package.

## Offline Mode
If API keys are missing, placeholder scenes and images are used and the system speech synthesizer is invoked for narration.

## License
Provided as-is for demonstration purposes.
